# OpenDDD.NET Code of Conduct

OpenDDD.NET is committed to fostering a respectful community where ideas are valued based on their own merits.
We are like-minded people who are passionate about domain-driven design and how it can be applied in a .NET environment.
Below are some of our values, check them out and please join if you think they match with your values!

## 1. We believe in true software

True software is simply what you strive to produce. Just like the ever evolving domain model, moving closer to the true model for each iteration.

## 2. We like discussing ideas

We simply like to discuss our ideas openly and with each other. So if that's your preference, our community might be a good fit for you.

## 3. We don't care about your other groups

Does your skin have the same color as someone else? Great, but we don't care. We are all here to discuss, evaluate and judge ideas.
