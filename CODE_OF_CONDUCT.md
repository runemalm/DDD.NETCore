# OpenDDD.NET Code of Conduct

OpenDDD.NET is committed to fostering a respectful community where ideas are valued based on their own merits. This mean we don't even care about race, skin color or other irrelevant external attributes of the individuals the ideas come from. We expect all participants to adhere to the following principles of respectful behavior:

## 1. Respect and Courtesy

Not all ideas need to be heard. We only want to hear the best ones. Make a judgement call if your idea is worth mentioning or if there are already other (better) ideas out on the table. With that said, don't refrain from bringing your idea up for discussion. You will find out if it seems worth listening to or not. Then either move on, giving up on the idea, or refine it and try again. Sometimes it's just not stated clear enough, sometimes it's simply not a good idea, or someone else already proposed a better one. Make a judgement call in every situation, the community will help steer the discussions towards respectful and effective exchange of ideas and thinking.

## 2. Facts Don't Care About Your Feelings

Do not discriminate against ideas based on the feelings of the reciptors. Embrace objective evaluation of ideas and promote a community where feelings are secondary to finding the objective truth.

## 3. Reporting Violations

We encourage taking up any issues one might have with each other directly with the person you have an issue with. If it can't be resolved, bring it up with the project maintainers and appropriate actions will be taken to address the situation.
