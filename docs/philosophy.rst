Design Patterns
###############

We believe in ``standing on the shoulders of giants``, and not to reinvent the wheel.

The software industry has summarized best design patterns and practices for software development and this framework is based on the following design patterns:

- `Domain-Driven Design <https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215>`_
- `Hexagonal Architecture <https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/>`_
- `Event-Carried State Transfer <https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html>`_
- `Near-infinite Scalability <https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3025012>`_
- `xUnit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit>`_
- `Expand and Contract <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ParallelChange.html>`_
- `Env files <https://12factor.net/config>`_

You are encouraged to ``read up on each of the patterns`` above. They are foundational for the framework and the better you know them the easier time you will have to get going using this framework.
